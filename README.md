## Style Guide

Font in the logo is Droid Sans (bold). Droid Sans has been replaced by Noto Sans (a new font based on Droid Sans) after the creation of the logo.

Use Noto Sans for normal text (bold for headings). https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Noto+Sans

For monospace (code etc) use Inconsolata. https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Inconsolata
